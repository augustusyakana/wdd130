    <h3>About Me:</h3>
    <p> Hi! My name is Augustus but all my friends call me Yuki.
        I am majoring in Software Development and going for a bachelors!
        I am married and we have 4 amazing kids! 3 boys and a little girl.
        I currently work full time as a safety coordinator in construction. 
        Although this job is already very rewarding, it's not what I want to 
        do forever. I am more interested in softwares and computers and all of it!
        I have been a member of the church since August 2010 and I have seen nothing
        but countless blessings ever since I joined. BYU-I is one of those blessings!
        I look forward to working with you all this semester.  
    </p>
